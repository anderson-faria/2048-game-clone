# 2048 Game Clone
 
This is a personal project (clone) of a puzzle game based on the popular <a href="https://play2048.co">2048 game</a> created by Gabriele Cirulli.
This game is currently being implemented on Unity game engine (version 2019.3.0a2).

## LOGS

### Version 0.1 (February 12, 2020)
- Player can move blocks to the left and to the right;
- Player can join blocks if they have the same number;
- Blocks can change color and size of font according to the number attached to it;
- A new block is added to a random index of the matrix after pressing any direction button (arrow keys or WASD);
- An animation plays when blocks with the same number unite and become a new block with double of their original value;
- Two blocks are added at the start of the game (2 and 2, 4 and 2 or 2 and 4, never 4 and 4).
